# VoxKartTracker2
Server Tracker for the kart racing, sonic fangame, Sonic Robo Blast 2 Kart. 

This is a desktop application that allows users to see all of the currently available and publickly reachable dedicated servers in the game. The application is set to refresh data at an incremental value changeable by the user.
Clicking on a server in the server list gives access to more information, such as: how many players are in the server, player names, and the ability to connect to a server from the application. (Provided you have one of the community builds installed)

A user can also search through the server list, which updates realtime with user input. Finally, the user can save a server to a list of "preferred" servers (like favorites), and toggle the application to show those servers only.
